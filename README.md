## Technical Aspects
This program was built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. The quiz was built and deployed through Render.

## Specifications
- The '/src' file contains all of the files necessary to run the program.
- The program imports data for the questions, answers, images, outcomes, and anything specific to the quiz via a JSON file, named 'data.json.' Thus, the code could be reused for any future quiz.
- 'main.js' contains the javascript necessary for the page interactivity, which is a mixture of both native JS and jQuery.
- 'style.css' contains the style document.
- 'index.html' is the quiz structure but can be repurposed for any quiz as all data is imported from the json file.
- 'data.json' contains the quiz data specific to this quiz- including questions, question data, question style specifics, answers, answer data, images, titles, etc.
- '/src/media' contains all of the images and gifs used for the project.
- 'algorithm.html' is a webpage that can be accessed by users from the main page footer that explains the quiz algorithm and how the results are calculated, if quiz takers are curious.
- 'art-credits.html' is a webpage that can be accessed by users from the main page footer and lists all of the artwork used and credits all of the artists, complete with links to their portfolios.
- 'code-resources.html' is a webpage that can be accessed by users from the main page footer and lists all of the sources used in order to complete the code for this project.
- 'related-quizzes.html' is a webpage that can be accessed by users from the main page footer and lists any related quizzes that I found that have been used for inspiration.
- 'info-style.css' is a style document for the info pages, which are algorithm, art-credits, code-resources, and related-quizzes.
- 'info.js' is the javascript necessary for the buttons specific to the info pages listed above.
